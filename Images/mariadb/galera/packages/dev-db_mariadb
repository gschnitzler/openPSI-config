# removing ~amd64 mask xtrabackup-bin forces the sst-xtrabackup USE flag from mariadb to use xtrabackup (without bin),

# for initialisation do now:
# run container with --privileged=true
# copy /etc/mysql to /data/
# edit my.cnf
# ln config back to /etc/mysql
# run emerge --config mariadb

# aside the database, the emerge --config above also creates directories, which we have to handle here
# however, this does not work with the diff creation at build, so empty directories are removed again.
# handle this at container start, but leave it here
mkdir -p /var/run/mysqld 
chown -R mysql.mysql /var/run/mysqld 
# this should now be handled via my.cf
#mkdir -p /var/log/mysql 
#chown -R mysql.mysql /var/log/mysql

# use our config
mv /etc/mysql /etc/mysql.dist
ln -s [% images.paths.CONFIG %]/mysql /etc

# enable syslog logging
# this option only works with mysqld_safe script. which only redirects STDOUT/ERR output to logger
# sed -i 's/MY_ARGS="/MY_ARGS="--syslog /' /etc/conf.d/mysql
