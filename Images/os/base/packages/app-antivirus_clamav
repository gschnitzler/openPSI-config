# clam needs loosened pax settings. was in a hurry, disabled all

#paxctl-ng -pemr /usr/sbin/clamd

# although installed as requirement for subsequent images, it is disabled, because its not needed right now and i think freshclam more often than not blocks booting of a machine.
#rc-update add clamd default

# initial av db needed for clamd to start
# default mirrors are really slow, find some faster one
# the daemon is setup in mta image, as clamav is not used by default (see comment above)

# --disable-zlib-vcheck is a workaround, see https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=604650
