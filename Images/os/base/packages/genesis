require.sh is executed twice during bootstrap, so unload requirements not needed by build plugins here.
minimal requirements have to be resolved before bootstrapping the build host via require.sh
all other dependencies go in here.

prefer gentoo packages. otherwise use cpanm in post
App::cpm is a nice tool to parallel install modules, similar to emerge. Due to its deps, its usefulness is offset by its own installation time.
However, it seems to be the right tool for local libraries. So whenever there is a move to (somewhat) fatpack genesis and ship it with its deps,
have a look at it.
