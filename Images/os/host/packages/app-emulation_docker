# since docker was split up in multiple binaries, it has become worse

# seriously. ive seen a lot of stupid shit from those morrons, but this is outrageous.
# the funny thing is they claim compatibility in their security docs with pax and grsec. yet non of them ever bothered to install anything but ubuntu.
