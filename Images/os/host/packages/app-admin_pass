# and as gpg is a stupid piece of shit, there is of course issues.
# this time around, the pinentry command executed by gpg-agent, when asking for the passphrase, will issue random errors
# reason is that the tty used is not owned by the user (root) that executes this.
# because su - was used from a shell. so the tty is still owned by the user who elevated via su -
# i am soon running out of hair to pull.
# anyway. as a workaround, set a user profile for root that chowns the tty used.
# it does not seem to be a problem for the initial user, when dropping back to that shell.
echo 'chown root:root $(tty)' > /root/.profile
echo 'export GPG_TTY=$(tty)' >> /root/.profile
# this is used to redirect pass to the right location, which cant be done via args (only relative paths)
# hardcoded path, because this has nothing todo with genesis, and there is no path variable for that
echo "export PASSWORD_STORE_DIR='/data/psi/config/Secrets'" >> /root/.profile

## we dont use the git extension.
#echo "app-admin/pass git" >> /etc/portage/package.use/pass
